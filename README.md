## Raspberry pi leds  project

### Components I used

-  1 Half sized breadboard

-  8 leds (any color will work)

-  8 220Ω resistors

-  9  Female to male jumper wires

### Extra requirements 

1. Python 3 

2. gpiozero3

Raspbian has installed by default Python 3 so you don't need to install it but you have to install gpiozero3, you can install it using apt-get as it is in raspbian's main  repository 

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gpiozero3`
